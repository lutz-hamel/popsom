Description: A self-organizing map package with three distinguishing features:
  (1) Automatic cluster centroid detection and visualization using starbursts.
  (2) Convergence index, a statistical quality measure based on the linear combination of map embedding and estimated topographic accuracy.
  (3) A very efficient stochastic training algorithm based on ideas from tensor algebra.
