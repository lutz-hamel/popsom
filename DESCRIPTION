Description: Kohonen's self-organizing maps with a number of distinguishing features:
    (1) A very efficient, single threaded, stochastic training algorithm based on ideas from tensor algebra.  Up to 60x faster than traditional single-threaded training algorithms. No special accelerator hardware required.
    (2) Automatic centroid detection and visualization using starbursts.
    (3) Two models of the data: (a) a self-organizing map model, (b) a centroid based clustering model.
    (4) A number of easily accessible quality metrics for the self-organizing map and the centroid based cluster model.
