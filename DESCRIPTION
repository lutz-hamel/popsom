Description: A self-organizing map package with three distinguishing features:
  (1) Automatic cluster centroid detection and visualization using starbursts.
  (2) Maintains two models of the data: (a) a self-organizing map model (b) a centroid based clustering model.
  (3) A very efficient stochastic training algorithm based on ideas from tensor algebra.
